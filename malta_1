As 31st of August is getting closer and closer - I wanted to kick off blogging about what I am going to do. After arriving in Malta I will also be forced to blog every week - as the programme that funds a part of the costs that will occur during my internship - requires me to do so. Knowing me you can probably assume that I would have done that anyways.

So- whats the plan?

So far I don't know all that much but that I will definitely be going to Malta for an internship. Moreover I already know the exact place where I am going to stay- namely "Sliema" which is right next to Valletta, the capital of Malta. Also the date is set already. You can come visiting me from 31st of August until 17th of October. That's everything I know. Where exactly I will be staying or much more important: where I'll be working... No clue so far. The women organizing the whole internship told us that we will probably find out about that two weeks before take-off.

That is why I can't really prepare for my job down there but I can find out all about Malta and its highlights. So far I know that it is pretty small(smaller than Bremen!), pretty warm(avaraging 25 Â°C in September!), pretty old(at least 6000 years inhabited), pretty rugged and so on and so on. Having a maximum width of 13 kilometers I am not quite sure yet if I wont get claustrophobic over there. But I am already looking forward to drive around the whole island by bike which is hopefully paved with some good roads.
